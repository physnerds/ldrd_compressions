# compressiontests

## Repository to test compression of waveform like data with different compression algorithms. Starting with SZ3

## Requirements
1. SZ3 (https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ3)
   Build SZ3 with bundled in zstd compression for the sake of simplicity.
2. HDF5 (CXX)
3. h5py (python library for HDF5)

## If you are using LCRC machine in Argonne:
  /soft/anaconda3/2021.05/condabin/conda activate /home/abashyal/.conda/envs/rootenv 
  rootenv should have the required dependencies.
